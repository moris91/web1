    <br>It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice.
    <br>Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, as for smoothies.
    <br>Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine production).
    <br>The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day).
    <br>Fruit juice consumption on average increases with country income level.</p>

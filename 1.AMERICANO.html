  <br>This drink consists of a single or double-shot of espresso combined with up to four or five ounces of hot water in a two-demitasse cup.
  <br>It is important to note, that an Americano is created by adding the water to an already extracted espresso, not by extracting extra water through a single espresso puck.
  <br>An Americano can be produced from lighter roasted coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as Ethiopian or Sumatran origins
